1,Oh my goodness if this actually works and it becomes the cure or the ultimate suppressor for people who don't have it this is going to be a major milestone
1,Hoping that unlike the other vaccine Moderna touted; this one actually works.
1,So many  people suffering. As early as possible  release in market. Every day very important day. All of researchers congrats

0,Perfectly timing huh?? any tactic to get you juiced up.
0,"Somewhat, same has been said with the CV19 jab. Yet, current CV19 jabs can't completely neutralise SCV2."
0,"Of course the vaccine boss comes out to say this, his job depends on it"
0,"I love how the pretence by sky news reporting this is to assume that the pharmaceutical companies are pure souls with no bad intentions, as if large deals worth billions of pounds that go into the pockets of their bosses have no bearing on their 'work' lol Don't worry friends, obviously its all for the greater good! whatever that means.."
0,"Given Moderna's share price is down 70% in the past 3 months, they had to launch a new product whether its actually needed or not."
0,"If the super booster doesn't work, I'm sure Moderna will come up with a super super booster."
0,"Are we going to have boosters as often as smartphone updates?
I'm amazed they still call it ""vaccines""!"
0,"Can we see where this going? A life-long reliance on drugs. A psychological need for constant CoViD ""jabs"". Imagine how much money pharma have made over the past year alone. Just think how powerful it will make them. How transparent does this need to be for people to catch on? Just try, for a second, to see how much of an incentive the money is for pharma to keep this going..."
0,"That guy looks and sounds so trustworthy... I'm surprised he didn't say to download his ebook linked in description. This is a ridiculous money making machine and we are getting speeches from sales and marketing guys at companies that benefit from all this chaos. At the same time preventative treatments are a myth and nobody focuses on minimising risk... This is a circus, where people just stomp on hippocratic oath."
0,"So the boss\medical expert from 'moderna',is saying this..and no one else is questioning a company pushing the virus panic button...lol."
0,"Needing a booster every couple of months shows how shady this is, it feels like it is making the body dependent rather than independent"
0,Don't do it people. Your immune system works just fine on its own.
0,Why should big pharma make all the money?
1,Hope this gets U.K. approval soon this is actually a vaccine I would take then hopefully I can go world travelling again.
1,Good to see the nurse aspirating that vaccine! Preventing an inadvertent intravascular injection is super important.
1,When will this Novavax be available in the US? I have vascular issues so the mRNA jabs haven't gone well for me and I'd like to hold out for protein based jab that wasn't rushed like the mRNAs were...
1,"Important for the EU to follow Abdala and Soberana vaccines from Cuba, where the cases are 60 per day today, and very mild reactions have resulted from their use in 10 millions of Cubans, also the millions immunized in Iran, Vietnam, Nicaragua and Venezuela with these vaccines."
1,"I think this might help end this, it looks like everyone will have a good vaccine doses or will get this variant and have anti bodies, so at least for a while after, most people will have vaccine and anti bodies at same time. No where for next variant to go."
1,"I got Novavax on their phase 3 trials in the USA, happy to have helped!"
1,"This js unexpected that EMA give approval before the UK as much of the trial and manufacturing is done.in.thr UK
this is good news tho this jab is cheaper and the requirements on cold chain is not as much as the MRNA"
0,"Every time you get the vaccine, a CEO buys a new house in the south of France."
0,When will natural immunity be recognized for its obvious effectiveness?
0,"Once I lose my common sense and decide to get a shot to avoid mild symptoms, I’ll let you know ??"
1,Finally. This vaccination has a promising role in immune compromised folks. Fewer side effects. We have 5 vaccines and 6 treatments. The virus has variants. Battle is joined in the last chapter of this pandemic. Getting 75% to 100 % of human adults vaccinated should make this manageable in 2022. The vaccination of children helps them and slows spread outside the school well. Over 4 billion people are vaccinated now at some level. There are 7.88 billion people on Earth ??.

0,Bahhh I smell sheep ??
0,"Does any one believe these BIG PHARMA PAID so called EXPERTS and MEDIA any more? Am vaccinated and Regrets that. After my experience and observation in the community I live, I honestly expected them to admit the fact that the vaccine (contrary to the info provided to us by the makers 94% effectiveness) was a failure. And I expected them to encourage us to sanitize, keep distance and Mask. Instead they are keeping on lying and promoting MORE and MORE of the vaccine that failed to protect us. Think about this they are not trying to convince unvaccinated to get one b/s it worked on us! They are pushing us (the vaccinated) to get more by SCARE TACTIC, which is FUTILE."
0,"Hey Mr. Pfizer CEO…… if the vaccines are so safe, why is your company immune from liability?"
0,"Pfizer should just start a monthly subscription for shots. ""Get your booster delivered right to your door every month, includes handy syringe too!"""
0,It will be a great Christmas for all of the big pharma shareholders
0,No-one should be allowed to force another person to have a medical procedure. No-one.
0,NO ONE should be forced into any medical procedure against their will. Period.
0,Theyre keeping sheep.
0,"Yep. I am unvaccinated as are my children. No one in my house has had Covid before. We are all very healthy.
My wife is fully vaccinated (her choice even though I asked her not to do it). Guess who got Covid first and spread it to the whole family?"
0,My other half got vaccinated. Been sick ever since. Don’t know if it’s related. I refuse to allow anyone tell me what to do. My body. My choice. Something like that anyway
1,"In Finland, when I got my booster last week they did aspirate. When I asked about it, they said they were advised to do so by the national health agency. For the very reasons mentioned in this channel. I have to admit I was happily surprised."
