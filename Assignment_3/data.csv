1,Oh my goodness if this actually works and it becomes the cure or the ultimate suppressor for people who don't have it this is going to be a major milestone
1,Hoping that unlike the other vaccine Moderna touted; this one actually works.
1,So many  people suffering. As early as possible  release in market. Every day very important day. All of researchers congrats

Just try, for a second, to see how much of an incentive the money is for pharma to keep this going..."
0,"That guy looks and sounds so trustworthy... I'm surprised he didn't say to download his ebook linked in description.

1,Hope this gets U.K. approval soon this is actually a vaccine I would take then hopefully I can go world travelling again.
1,Good to see the nurse aspirating that vaccine! Preventing an inadvertent intravascular injection is super important.
1,When will this Novavax be available in the US? I have vascular issues so the mRNA jabs haven't gone well for me and I'd like to hold out for protein based jab that wasn't rushed like the mRNAs were...
1,"Important for the EU to follow Abdala and Soberana vaccines from Cuba, where the cases are 60 per day today, and very mild reactions have resulted from their use in 10 millions of Cubans, also the millions immunized in Iran, Vietnam, Nicaragua and Venezuela with these vaccines."
1,"I think this might help end this, it looks like everyone will have a good vaccine doses or will get this variant and have anti bodies, so at least for a while after, most people will have vaccine and anti bodies at same time. No where for next variant to go."
1,"I got Novavax on their phase 3 trials in the USA, happy to have helped!"
1,"This js unexpected that EMA give approval before the UK as much of the trial and manufacturing is done.in.thr UK
this is good news tho this jab is cheaper and the requirements on cold chain is not as much as the MRNA"

1,Finally. This vaccination has a promising role in immune compromised folks. Fewer side effects. We have 5 vaccines and 6 treatments. The virus has variants. Battle is joined in the last chapter of this pandemic. Getting 75% to 100 % of human adults vaccinated should make this manageable in 2022. The vaccination of children helps them and slows spread outside the school well. Over 4 billion people are vaccinated now at some level. There are 7.88 billion people on Earth ??.

0,"Does any one believe these BIG PHARMA PAID so called EXPERTS and MEDIA any more? Am vaccinated and Regrets that. After my experience and observation in the community I live, I honestly expected them to admit the fact that the vaccine (contrary to the info provided to us by the makers 94% effectiveness) was a failure. And I expected them to encourage us to sanitize, keep distance and Mask. Instead they are keeping on lying and promoting MORE and MORE of the vaccine that failed to protect us. Think about this they are not trying to convince unvaccinated to get one b/s it worked on us! They are pushing us (the vaccinated) to get more by SCARE TACTIC, which is FUTILE."

0,Theyre keeping sheep.
0,"Yep. I am unvaccinated as are my children. No one in my house has had Covid before. We are all very healthy.
My wife is fully vaccinated (her choice even though I asked her not to do it). Guess who got Covid first and spread it to the whole family?"
0,My other half got vaccinated. Been sick ever since. Don?t know if it?s related. I refuse to allow anyone tell me what to do. My body. My choice. Something like that anyway
1,"In Finland, when I got my booster last week they did aspirate. When I asked about it, they said they were advised to do so by the national health agency. For the very reasons mentioned in this channel. I have to admit I was happily surprised."
1,"I had my second shot of pfizer 3 weeks ago. I felt rough for about a week, I have also seen the horror stories surrounding these vaccines. Thank you so much for this video brilliantly explained and reassuring."
1,"Thanks for explaining while also acknowledging that the concerns are understandable. I've been trying to research this, but every article has such a condescending tone. The world is so rife with misinformation and conspiracy theories, it's difficult to know who to trust. Your explanations are easy to understand for me, and I'm someone who has a hard time interpreting the scientific data. I appreciate the info."
1,"To the point, reassuring and factual information delivered without wasting my time. Great video as usual. Thx alot for doing you guys do. Much appreciated ??"
1,"Thank you ,Doctor. You were thorough and put my mind at ease regarding the vaccine. I wish I had a doctor like you who explained things with so much passion and compassion."
1,"I appreciate you, Doctor for the insightful video! Thank you for raising awareness about the vaccine and providing your professional opinion.
You were thorough easing certain doubts and busting myths. Keep continuing the good job."
1,"Thank you for this well-explained video. One question, do you know whether concerns about the impact of the vaccine on male/female fertility are warranted? Thank you again"
1,Thank you for making this video. It really made me feel better about getting a vaccine.
1,thanks a lot for making this video. im getting my first vaccine on friday and was pretty nervous about the long term affects. feel a lot better about my decision to get vaccinated now.
1,"Thanks for this video. I got the Moderna three days ago. The only effect I've had is muscle ache. I'm due to get the second dose next month. I hear the second one's the toughest, so I'm nervous."
1,"Very thorough, very well informed. Great video Doctor, thank you for this!"
1,"Many thanks for your excellent video, which has certainly reassured me! I'm in England and had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine this morning. My only concern is that we've been told we'll have to wait up to 12 weeks to get our second dose. Do you think this might weaken the effectiveness of the vaccine? I've subscribed ??"
1,I had a fever and fatigue with both doses :/ I was not expecting that for BOTH doses for a whole day. I felt pretty bummy not gonna lie lol. But I'm glad I did it just so I can be part of the herd immunity community so we can go back to normal as fast as possible.
1,thank you so much for easing certain doubts.... a few of us nursing students will be getting the vaccine soon and i think we'll take our chances! ?
1,"This doctor gives me hope. I had the first Moderna shot, and am so scared to get the second, because of what I hear. After watching people with Covid-19 online......the shot is worth it."
1,I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine 2 months ago and so far I have been filling fine with no problems. The only thing I had from it was just two side effects from it and that was it and since then I have been filling fine but a little scared because of all the rumors going around
1,Thank you for the information I got my first shot yesterday (Pfizer) and I feel like total crap lol. I did have COVID and it was way worse than this.
1,I'm getting mine as soon as it's available for me! My grandmother for her first phizer vaccine today and is doing very well so far.
1,Thanks for the information. After vaccination I had fever at night and flue like symptoms. 2nd day subsided after 3 doses if paracetamol tablets
0,Why I never been vaccine it and I live a normal life in Canada ???? I never get sick? I go everywhere even work with the public. Tell me why?
0,I took the John and Janssen vaccine and feels like you're taking LSD now I'm not saying this is for all the vaccine but I kind of have Psychedelics trip for instance

IM  DRUG  FREE  AND  VACCINE  FREE."
0,Where do you get the "90 to 94%" efficiency rates?  No vaccine ever has such a high rate of protection.  As these vaccines are in the experimental phases we can't make such assessments.  Heavily vaccinated countries show high rates of infection.  The only observable effects of the vaccines is a dampened down hospitalisation rate.  I think these figures have been manipulated by various agencies who benefit financially from the sale of these vaccines.
1,I took the Pfizer Vaccine which is great ??
1,While in philippines  2 shot  and first  dose in different brand ??

0,I wonder if she would feel the same after watching Vaxxed ( Vaxxed 2)... I wonder if her thesis would be the same after seeing the families affected by the side effects of those who did get the vaccines. I comment this because she pointed out the saving of "one child" is enough reason...
0,"Where I live, which is the state of Mississippi, we have the most sick children in America. And we are one of only three states where vaccines are forced if you want your children to actually go to school. We are the one state with the most sick children and we are the state who gives the most vaccines."
0,"Don't worry guys, the worlds least trusted source assures us everything is fine."
0,If there is a question this shot is dangerous why take it? The world has gone insane in love with the vaccine for no reason
1,I took vaccine and my wife did had no trouble getting her pregnant definantly not a good form of birth control.
1,"Incredible video. Literally just turned me pro vaccine, 100% brother ??"
1,Wow! I'm fully a pro-vaxer yet still found I had believed one of the myths! It never sat well with me that I "knew" for a "fact" that vaccinated people can "still spread the virus" I'm so grateful for finally seeing perspective on this issue!
1,"Hello, and thanks for this video! I'm a health care worker and have had all my vaccinations thus far, but have become a vaccine sceptic, due to being bombarded by the anti vaxx narrative. But, also, I must admit, it didn't help my scepticism the way that the government has imposed vaccinations on us so aggressively, I believe it should be a choice, not forced onto us. Anyways, I'm going to finally book my first vaccine shot this week, after seeing your video. I've had enough of the conspiracy theories and all the surrounding bs."
1,I got the moderna and it was easier than a flu shot. Still glad I watched this video because learning about the en vitro fetal cells being used to develop the J&J vax was really cool. Would definitely like to learn more about how they do that.
1,Just found your video. Thanks for all the links/explanations. I have been countering myths and misinformation regarding SARS-CoV-2 on numerous channels. (It can be somewhat exhausting at times.) Your video will be of great use in that regard.
1,"Thanks Doc, getting my vaccine today. This helped alleviate alot of the concerns I have. 
Crazy the amount of anti-vax stuff online lately, really freaked me out."
0,"my daughter spent the night in the ER last Monday. I have photos of her clots which were 3-4 inches long. This was her first cycle following her first dose of Pfizer. She's never had problems before. The one nurse who looked at the photos (which hospital staff asked her to take so they could see what she was complaining about) said that her sister had the same type of clots following the vax. However, staff would not list these huge, abnormal clots as a side effect of the vax.  The clots came every 20-30 minutes. Very scary & unusual. Needless to say, she will not be getting the 2nd dose"
1,Thanks Doctor for the great video. I had been on the fence from all the negativity from family members for exactly the myths which you have answered in the video. Your video has put my back on track to trust in science and data rather than all the gossip and myth that is floating around.
1,I have been on the fence...worried about long term effects. I scheduled my vaccine after watching this video...Thank you for explaining everything so well.
1,Your reply and info is appreciated. So much clear info re covid-19 and vaccines means I will get vaxxed.
1,I hope this will open some minds. I don't generally listen to anyone medical except my dr. but I am bombarded by all the misinformation so needed to do some research on my own. Thank you for clarity.
1,I got the Pfizer vaccine and I am very pleased that I did.
1,Mfs being scared of a microchip tracking them in their body when they carry a phone that's prone to being hacked on them 24/7
1,thank you for the explanations. I hope it will convince some people to get vaccinated.
1,I have my appointment for Pfizer vaccine today
1,"Great video, I'll be sending it to my vaccine hesitant family members"
1,In here so I can answer my relatives when they try to cast doubt on vaccine on me.
0,I think the most important point here is why force it? If the vaccine is so great people should WANT it and not be FORCED to get it! That simple point is what is making people skeptical.
1,"This is probably THE best video debunking anti-vax claims. While the first one isn't quite well after Pfizer got approved last month, it still holds pretty strong so thanks!"
0,"I'm hesitant and I'm NOT an anti vaxxer, legit AM NOT and have gotten every single vaccine ever required but I don't think ""Get the vaccine or lose your job"" (which is starting, and I LOVE my job) is cool at all"
1,My Mother and I received our 2nd dose of Pfizer just yesterday.
0,I just don't understand why the Covid 19 vacation is being pushed so hard
0,For the first time in history medicines failures are being blamed on those who didn't take it
1,"thanks for this video. I've been around family who are very anti-vax and I felt like I was becoming worried with all the fearmongering they were doing - I really needed this information to snap me out of it! 

Sometimes people's thoughts turn into an echo chamber, and you never hear rational, well-researched points of reasoning. Thank you for this high quality video! I'll definitely be sharing it."
1,"I think this is very helpful information. Unfortunately, in Japan, there are a few people who are skeptical about vaccines. I hope that the correct knowledge will spread."
1,Vaccines are an incredible thing and I'm grateful that we have them
1,please get vaxxed
1,Vaccination is good
1,"Covid is bad, get the vaccine people"
1,"Thanks Doctor, you convinced me, I will get the shot :)"
